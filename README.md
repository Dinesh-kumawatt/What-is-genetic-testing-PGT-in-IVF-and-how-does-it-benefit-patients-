PGT (Preimplantation Genetic Testing) is used during IVF to check embryos for genetic abnormalities before implantation. It helps reduce miscarriage risks, improves success rates, and ensures healthier pregnancies. PGT is beneficial for couples with a history of genetic disorders, repeated IVF failures, or advanced maternal age. Trinity IVF Ahmedabad provides advanced genetic screening services to offer a clearer path to a successful pregnancy. Though optional, PGT gives peace of mind to many couples by increasing the likelihood of a healthy baby. It’s an excellent tool to personalize your fertility care, especially if there’s a known genetic concern.
